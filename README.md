# BetterBlueBox
Software replica of Jobs and Wozniaks' <a href='http://www.historyofphonephreaking.org/docs.php'>BlueBox</a>, which could dial into the old Bell telephone network to place free local and long-distance calls.

Try it out <a href='http://FilipMiscevic.github.io/BetterBlueBox'>here</a> and instantly turn your computer or smartphone into a Bluebox!

While this doesn't work on modern telephone equipment, enthusiasts have made it possible to replicate the experience by dialing into <a href='http://projectmf.org/intro.html'>ProjectMF</a> maintained by Dan Froula! Just dial the ProjectMF number, then use this as you would a regular Bluebox. 
See the ProjectMF page for instructions on how to use a Bluebox.

FEATURES:
- use your keyboard or click to play back a digit
- type and dial a number
- supports red, white, silver and bluebox modes as well as SF mode
- decode MF and DTMF tones in realtime
- tested on ProjectMF, results may vary

Send me a message if there are features you'd like to see added. I certainly have an idea for a few of them myself, which I might get to at some point:
- SIP tone generation

Known issues:
- there is a delay when using the mobile version of the site from when a key is pressed until audio starts to play. This appears to be a hardware issue and I am trying to figure out a workaround.
- the decoder isn't perfect, and doesn't work in SF mode. You may have to adjust for volume/noise to get it to properly recognize digits, though I got pretty good results even with my laptop speaker

In memory of Stefan Andreas Scheytt (a.k.a. Onkel Dittmeyer), phreak and creator of an excellent piece of software called BlueBEEP.
