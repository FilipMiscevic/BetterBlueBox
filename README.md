# BetterBlueBox
Software replica of Jobs and Wozniaks' <a href='http://www.historyofphonephreaking.org/docs.php'>BlueBox</a>, which could dial into the old Bell telephone network to place free local and long-distance calls.

Try it out <a href='http://FilipMiscevic.github.io/BetterBlueBox'>here</a>!

While this doesn't work on modern telephone equipment, enthusiasts have made it possible to replicate the experience by dialing into <a href='http://projectmf.org/intro.html'>ProjectMF</a>! Just dial the ProjectMF number, then use this as you would a regular Bluebox. See the ProjectMF page for instructions on how to use a Bluebox.

Send me a message if there are features you'd like to see added. I certainly have an idea for a few of them myself, which I might get to some point:
- add support for a Redbox
