# BetterBlueBox
Software replica of Jobs and Wozniaks' Bluebox, which could hack the analogue telephone network to place free calls.
History of phone phreaking: http://www.historyofphonephreaking.org/docs.php

While this doesn't work on modern telephone equipment, enthusiasts have made it possible to replicate the experience by dialing into ProjectMF (http://projectmf.org/intro.html)! Just dial the ProjectMF number, then use this as you would a regular bluebox.

Send me a message if there are features you'd like to see added. I certainly have an idea for a few of them myself, which I might get to some point:
- add support for a Redbox
